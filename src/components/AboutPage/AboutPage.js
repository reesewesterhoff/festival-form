      Miscommunication and lost emails are common and a source of great frustration in the world of professional live concert production. 
      Festival Form  was developed to help streamline communication between music festival organizers and band tour managers to create well-organized festivals. 
      Band tour managers are able to upload their current information and RSVP to music festivals. 
      Music festival organizers can create festivals, see who has responded to each festival, and download each respondents information.
