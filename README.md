# Festival Form
Miscommunication and lost emails are common and a source of great frustration in the world of professional live concert production. Festival Form  was developed to help streamline communication between music festival organizers and band tour managers to create well-organized events. Band tour managers are able to upload their relevant information and RSVP to music festivals. Music festival organizers can create festivals, see who has responded to each festival, and download each respondentâ€™s information.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)


## Getting Started

* Click the `Clone or Download` button and select `Download Zip`.
* Unzip the project and start with the code in that folder.
* Create a new GitHub project and push this code to the new repository.

To get this project up and running on your local machine, the following steps are necessary.

In the database GUI, create a database called `"festival_form"`.

Inside the `festival_form` database, copy, paste, and execute the following queries.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE person (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "first_name" VARCHAR (255),
    "last_name" VARCHAR (255),
    "email" VARCHAR (255),
    password VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);


CREATE TABLE "festival" (
	"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"name" VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	"date" DATE NOT NULL,
	"image" VARCHAR,
	"address" VARCHAR
);



CREATE TABLE "band_info" (
	"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"tech_rider" VARCHAR,
	"band_rider" VARCHAR,
	"stage_plot" VARCHAR,
	"input_list" VARCHAR,
	"person_id" INT REFERENCES "person" NOT NULL
);


CREATE TABLE "festival_band_info" (
	"id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	"name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"tech_rider" VARCHAR,
	"band_rider" VARCHAR,
	"stage_plot" VARCHAR,
	"input_list" VARCHAR,
	"arrival_time" TIME,
	"requests" VARCHAR,
	"notes" VARCHAR,
	"festival_id" INT REFERENCES "festival" ON DELETE CASCADE,
	"band_info_id" INT REFERENCES "band_info" NOT NULL
);



--Dummy festival data
INSERT INTO "festival" ("name", "date", "image", "address")
VALUES ('lollapalooza', '2017/08/02', 'https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2018%2F08%2Flollapalooza-2018-livestream-0.jpg?fit=max&cbr=1&q=90&w=1024&h=683', 'Grant Park, IL'), ('coachella', '2017/04/12', 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/coachella2017-theme/img/coachella-social-share.png', 'Indio, CA');
```

## Development Setup Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:5000`


## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy

## Update Documentation

Customize this ReadMe and the code comments in this project to read less like a starter repo and more like a project. Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
